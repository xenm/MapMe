## Known Issues & Resolutions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Moq + .NET 10 Preview Compatibility**
**Issue**: 5 tests failing due to `IJSVoidResult` not being available in .NET 10 preview SDK

**Impact**: Minor - affects only JavaScript interop mocking in unit tests

**Workarounds**:
1. Integration tests provide full end-to-end validation
2. Business logic tests validate core functionality
3. Service-level tests ensure API contract compliance

**Future Resolution**: 
- Replace Moq with custom JSRuntime mock implementation
- Consider NSubstitute as alternative mocking framework
- Update when .NET 10 RTM includes missing interfaces
