## Operations Overview

MapMe operations focus on reliability, performance, and security:

### Operational Principles
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Early detection of issues
- **Automated Response**: Automated remediation where possible
- **Incident Management**: Structured incident response
- **Continuous Improvement**: Post-incident learning and optimization
- **Security First**: Security considerations in all operations

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Response Time**: < 500ms for API endpoints
- **Error Rate**: < 0.1% error rate
- **Recovery Time**: < 15 minutes for critical issues

## Monitoring Strategy

### Application Monitoring
- **Health Endpoints**: `/health` and `/ready` endpoint monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, and error rates
- **Business Metrics**: User registrations, DateMark creation, chat activity
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific KPIs

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- **Database Performance**: Query performance and connection health
- **External Dependencies**: Google Maps API, OAuth services
- **Security Events**: Authentication failures, suspicious activity

### Alerting Strategy
- **Critical Alerts**: Immediate response required (< 5 minutes)
- **Warning Alerts**: Investigation required (< 30 minutes)
- **Info Alerts**: Awareness notifications (< 2 hours)
- **Escalation**: Automated escalation for unacknowledged alerts

## Logging Architecture

### Log Levels
- **Error**: Application errors and exceptions
- **Warning**: Potential issues and degraded performance
- **Information**: Normal application flow and business events
- **Debug**: Detailed diagnostic information (development only)

### Secure Logging Policy
- **No Sensitive Data**: JWT tokens sanitized with `ToTokenPreview()`
- **Email Protection**: Only metadata logged, never raw addresses
- **Input Sanitization**: All user input sanitized with `SanitizeForLog()`
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent log format with Serilog

### Log Aggregation
- **Centralized Logging**: All logs aggregated in central system
- **Search and Analysis**: Full-text search and log analysis
- **Retention Policy**: 90-day retention for audit and debugging
- **Export Capability**: Log export for compliance and analysis

## Incident Management

### Incident Classification
- **Severity 1**: Critical system outage affecting all users
- **Severity 2**: Major functionality impaired for subset of users
- **Severity 3**: Minor issues with workarounds available
- **Severity 4**: Cosmetic issues or feature requests

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring or user reports
2. **Assessment**: Determine severity and impact
3. **Response**: Activate appropriate response team
4. **Communication**: Update status page and stakeholders
5. **Resolution**: Implement fix and verify restoration
6. **Post-Mortem**: Document lessons learned and improvements

## Maintenance Procedures

### Routine Maintenance
- **Database Maintenance**: Index optimization and cleanup
- **Log Rotation**: Automated log cleanup and archival
- **Security Updates**: Regular security patch application
- **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization and caching tuning

### Scheduled Maintenance
- **Deployment Windows**: Planned deployment schedules
- **Database Migrations**: Schema updates and data migrations
- **Infrastructure Updates**: Server and service updates
- **Backup Verification**: Regular backup and restore testing

## Capacity Planning

### Resource Monitoring
- **Usage Trends**: Historical resource utilization analysis
- **Growth Projections**: User growth and feature adoption forecasts
- **Performance Baselines**: Established performance benchmarks
- **Scaling Triggers**: Automated scaling thresholds

### Scaling Strategies
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Additional server instances
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increased server resources
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas and partitioning
- **CDN Optimization**: Content delivery network utilization

## Security Operations

### Security Monitoring
- **Authentication Events**: Login attempts and failures
- **Authorization Violations**: Access control violations
- **API Abuse**: Rate limiting and suspicious patterns
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security assessments

### Security Incident Response
- **Threat Detection**: Automated threat detection systems
- **Incident Classification**: Security incident severity levels
- **Response Team**: Dedicated security response team
- **Forensic Analysis**: Post-incident security analysis
