## Troubleshooting Overview

This section provides systematic approaches to diagnosing and resolving issues in MapMe:

### Problem Categories
- **Critical**: System outages and data loss
- **High**: Major functionality impaired
- **Medium**: Minor issues with workarounds
- **Low**: Cosmetic issues and enhancements

### Diagnostic Approach
1. **Identify Symptoms**: What is the observed behavior?
2. **Gather Information**: Logs, error messages, reproduction steps
3. **Isolate the Problem**: Narrow down to specific component or service
4. **Apply Solution**: Implement fix or workaround
5. **Verify Resolution**: Confirm problem is resolved
6. **Document**: Update troubleshooting guides with new solutions
